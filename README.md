# 8ball

This plugin is a fun "game" that adds the 8ball, which can be used to make your choices in-game!

# Usage

To use the 8ball, simply type in chat "::8ball", and you will receive a message that will be your fate!

# Features

- "::8ball" gives you an answer either a "yes" or a "no", with various phrases.
- "::8ball skill" chooses a random skill for you to train!
- Certain locations give you specific messages (WIP, still adding some!)
- "::8ball quest" gives you a random order of activities for you to do! Can you finish the quest?
- "::8ball choice" gives you a "Would You Rather" scenario, choose one of them!

# Contact me

Note: Discord contact is currently closed because of the sheer amount of automated accounts adding me out of nowhere to advertise random stuff, so to avoid accidental ignoring, just use email or add me from the Runelite server.

I will also try to answer on email, but don't be too sure the answer will be as quick as on Discord! My email is "duhontheguy@gmail.com".

# Update 1.2

- Added "::8ball quest" and "::8ball choice"
